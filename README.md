<p>
I'm a data science student who is passionate about data visualizations, data ethics, as well as data in/around electrical systems. I also have a deep passion for live audio and live event production technology. The repositories here are mostly me playing around with either python or R code for my own personal learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me discing, researching home theater, or riding my penny board around Calvin University's 390 acres.</p>

### ðŸ’¼ Past Work ðŸ’¼

[Schneider Natioinal](https://schneider.com/): Advanced Analytics Intern (Summer 2021)
 - Diagnosed data reporting errors.
 - Wrote python and sql solutions to fix data discrepancies.
 - Built dashboard showcasing internal employee data.
 - Collaborated with team members on rapid python development.

### ðŸ’¼ Where I Currently Work ðŸ’¼

[Calvin University](https://calvin.edu): Audio Engineer

### ðŸ’» Currently Working On:

- A [visualization](https://github.com/adamddh/MI-COVID-Viz/blob/master/MiCorona.md) on goverment supplied COVID-19 data for the state of michigan. This is a good practice in both python and R for web-scraping, data cleaning, and visualization. 

- Quick python programming, such as web-scraping, maintenance scripts, and bots. 

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning More About:

- High Performance Computing
    - A study of architectures, algorithms and programming techniques that help minimize the execution times of computer programs that solve particular problems. Topics include high performance computer architectures, parallel programming techniques for distributed and shared-memory multiprocessors, code optimization and hands-on experience using the Calvin University supercomputer.
- Database Management Systems
    - An introduction to the structures necessary to implement a database management system. Topics include data models (including hierarchical, network and relational data models), normal forms for data relations, data description languages, query facilities. An introduction to existing database management systems is given.
- Computer Architecture and Digital System Design
    - Design of advanced digital systems using programmable logic, Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and microprocessors. Microprocessor architecture including pipelining, memory hierarchy, cache, instruction set architecture, CPU control, bus standards, I/O, superscalar, and Very Long Instructive Word (VLIW) approaches. Interfacing and communication techniques, including data error detection and correction codes. Introduction to parallel processing.
- Electrical Signals & Systems
    - Advanced techniques for the analysis of analog electrical systems. Topics include: frequency domain analysis, Laplace transforms, Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and continuous versus discrete signal analysis. Frequency response is analyzed using transfer functions, Bode plots, and spectral plots. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is introduced.

### ðŸ“š Academic Experience:
