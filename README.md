<p>
I'm a data science student who is passionate about data visualizations, data ethics, as well as data in/around electrical systems. I also have a deep passion for live audio and live event production technology. The repositories here are mostly me playing around with either python or R code for my own personal learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me discing, researching home theater, or on a ride on my penny board.</p>

### ðŸ’¼ Where I Currently Work ðŸ’¼

[Calvin University](https://calvin.edu): Audio Engineer

### ðŸ’» Currently Working On:

- The [January Series](https://calvin.edu/january-series/): Running front of house for this series of free liberal arts lectures broadcast live across the planet to 4,000 people. 

- A [visualizaion](https://github.com/adamddh/MI-COVID-Viz/blob/master/MiCorona.md) on goverment supplied COVID-19 data for the state of michigan. This is a good practice in both python and R for web-scraping, data cleaning, and visualization. 

- Quick python programming, such as web-scraping, maintenance scripts, and bots. 

- Gearing up for the 2021 spring semester. 

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning More About:

- Electrical Engineering Courses: 
    - An introduction to the theory and application of electronic circuits and devices. Topics include:  basic linear circuits (including frequency and transient response), semiconductor devices (diodes, op-amps, comparators, etc.), electric power, electric safety, and DC machines. 
    - An introduction to the fundamental principles of logic design in digital systems. Topics include: Boolean algebra, analysis and synthesis of combinational and sequential networks, register transfer language, micro-operational description and applications to computer design, computer organization and assembly language programming, and asynchronous logic.
- Computational Bayesian Statistics:
    - Conjugate prior distributions are studied, but computational methods are emphasized and developed in the context of practical data analysis methods.
- Computer System Admin:
    - A holistic introduction to the support of organizational information technology infrastructure. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About:

- Python solutions for everyday problems, especially "busy work" problems.
