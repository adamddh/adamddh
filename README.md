I'm a software developer who is passionate about data visualizations, data ethics, as well as data in/around electrical systems. The repositories here are mostly me playing around with either python or R code for my own personal learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me discing, researching home theater, or riding my penny board around Calvin University's 390 acres.</p>
